If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime." This wisdom rings especially true in todayâ€™s Web3 space, where more wallets and tokens flood in daily, but for many young Africans, finding stable sources of income within the industry remains a challenge. Without reliable work, they rely on airdrops and effortless mintingâ€”only to discover that many platforms give little in return or turn out to be scams. 

On centralized social media platforms, creators face a different, but equally frustrating, struggle: strict rules and algorithms that prioritize established influencers. For emerging voices, monetizing content like art, music, and writing requires meeting complex standards, making income inaccessible to many. Nebulax is built to change that.

With **Nebulax**, young African creators can finally bypass these unreliable and centralized systems. This NFT marketplace is a secure, transparent space where artists, musicians, and other creatives can upload, mint, and monetize their work directly, free from the risks of scams or gatekeeping algorithms. Nebulax provides a true home for creators, offering them sustainable earning opportunities within the Web3 ecosystem and a reliable way to fund their wallets and futures.

## How it was made/Tools used?
We brainstormed together as a team and here we a workable MVP 
the following tools were used:

- **User interface**: Figma

- **Frontend** : Tailwind Css, React, amd JavaScript
  
- **Smart contract**:
remix for testing 
hardhart
arbitrum sepolia
openzeppelin library

- **API**: Vottun

- **Blockchain network**: Arbitrum 


## Why Vottun Api
The web3 space is still currently young and evolving around the globe and particularly in Africa as a continent.
using Vottun Api creates a smoothless and borderless interaction for new users in the space and also helping devs build dapps faster and more easier.

## Challenges faced?
Language barrier with most of the workshop videos. fellow builders weren't discussing in the group, 
we couldn't access office hours with mentors who will guide us up with the project.
Redoing the UI to fit the technicality of the project.
Difficulty understanding the Vottun Api, and using as a backend as well as communicating with the frontend 
was a major blocker for us as a team.

## What we learned 
We learnt the phrase teamwork makes the dream work.
through this project we understoood the pain point of many African's youths so with that pressure we were able to use the combination of our hard skills and soft skills together to bring NebulaX to reality.
We also learned more about the vision of cryptoconexion and the impact of women in the web3 space.
And lastly we learnt as a team that **DONE** is better than **PERFECT** 


## Futrure roadmap?
We just released an MVP version 
our future implementations will imclude the following? 

- A responsive mobile web application
- A mobile app version for the Ios and Android playstore respectively
- Release the Beta version of this product next year
- Onboard the next 5 million Content creators to digital creators by 2027
