If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime." This wisdom rings especially true in todayâ€™s Web3 space, where more wallets and tokens flood in daily, but for many young Africans, finding stable sources of income within the industry remains a challenge. Without reliable work, they rely on airdrops and effortless mintingâ€”only to discover that many platforms give little in return or turn out to be scams. 

On centralized social media platforms, creators face a different, but equally frustrating, struggle: strict rules and algorithms that prioritize established influencers. For emerging voices, monetizing content like art, music, and writing requires meeting complex standards, making income inaccessible to many. Nebulax is built to change that.

With **Nebulax**, young African creators can finally bypass these unreliable and centralized systems. This NFT marketplace is a secure, transparent space where artists, musicians, and other creatives can upload, mint, and monetize their work directly, free from the risks of scams or gatekeeping algorithms. Nebulax provides a true home for creators, offering them sustainable earning opportunities within the Web3 ecosystem and a reliable way to fund their wallets and futures.

## What it Does
NebulaX creates a seamless onboarding experience for users, making it easy and fun to earn in Web3. We focus on two primary users:

### Creators (Sellers):
- Connect wallet
- Create token
- Assign token ID
- Verify KYC
- Upload content
- Mint content as NFT
- Set product descriptions and pricing
  
### Buyers:
- Connect wallet
- Create token
- Get token ID
- Verify KYC
- Purchase NFTs
  
## How It Was Made & Tools Used
  
Our team collaborated to develop a workable MVP using the following tools:

- User Interface: Figma
- Frontend: Tailwind CSS, React, JavaScript
- Smart Contract Development: Remix for testing, Hardhat, Arbitrum Sepolia, OpenZeppelin library
- API: Vottun
- Blockchain Network: Arbitrum

## Why We Chose Vottun API
With Web3 still in its early stages, especially in Africa, Vottun API provides a frictionless and borderless experience for new users, helping developers build dApps faster and more efficiently. It enables seamless backend integration, enhancing the user journey and making Web3 accessible for everyone.

## Challenges Faced
- Language barriers with workshop videos
- Limited group discussions with fellow builders
- Lack of access to mentor office hours for project guidance
- Adapting the UI to fit project requirements
- Understanding and implementing Vottun API for backend and frontend communication presented major challenges

## What We Learned
Working on NebulaX taught us that **"teamwork makes the dream work."** This project deepened our understanding of the challenges facing African youth, motivating us to blend our technical and soft skills to bring NebulaX to life. We also learned more about the vision of CryptoConexion, the importance of women in Web3, and the value of progress over perfection: **DONE is better than PERFECT.**

## Future Roadmap
With our MVP now live, weâ€™re looking ahead to these next steps:
- Develop a responsive mobile web application
- Launch a mobile app for iOS and Android
- Release a beta version next year
- Onboard 5 million African digital creators by 2027
